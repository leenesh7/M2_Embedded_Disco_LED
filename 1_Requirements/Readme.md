## Introduction:
Serial LEDs or Serial lights are widely used in many celebrations. They are used in Marriage functions, office parties, pubs and so on.... Our project is based on electrical and electronics combinational circuit technology is used to develop the automatic light system. The system is developed with safety environment when switching ON or OFF the light whenever we want.

## Components:
* Atmega328
* LEDs
* RelaySPST-57
* AudioOut-58
* Fixed Voltage 5V


## SOFTWARE USED :

* SimulIDE
* Atmel studio

## DESCRIPTION :

### ATMEGA328
 
 * Microchip's ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-pin AVR Microcontroller that uses RISC architecture and includes a 32KB flash-type programme memory.
 * The Atmega328 microcontroller is found in the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Nano boards.
 * It can function at voltages ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 volts, but we usually choose 5 volts as a standard.
 * Cost-effectiveness, low power consumption, programming lock for security, and true timer counter with independent oscillator are only a few of its outstanding      qualities.
 * It's most commonly found in Embedded Systems. Take a look at these Real-Life Embedded System Examples; we can design all of them with this Microcontroller.
 
 ### LED - LIGHT EMITTING DIODE


* LED stands for light emitting diode. LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. How do they work. An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light.

* The high efficiency and directional nature of LEDs makes them ideal for many industrial uses. LEDs are increasingly common in street lights, parking garage lighting, walkway and other outdoor area lighting, refrigerated case lighting, modular lighting, and task lighting.


### FIXED VOLT 

* A fixed voltage regulator produces a fixed DC output voltage, which is either positive or negative. In other words, some fixed voltage regulators produce positive fixed DC voltage values, while others produce negative fixed DC voltage values.

### Relay 
A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.

### Audio output
An audio output device is a device that turns the sound waves data that a computer generates into usable sound signals.
